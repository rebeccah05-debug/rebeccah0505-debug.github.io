# Let the Sims Begin

Welcome to _The_ [_Sims 4_](https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4)_!_ _The Sims 4_ is a life simulation game where players create characters (sims) and control their day-to-day lives. Gameplay is open-ended with a variety of ways to play, including designing homes, fostering relationships, and choosing careers. There's no wrong way to play -- **just have fun!**

## About this Manual

This manual is meant to help new players get started and gain confidence by overviewing general applications of the game.


This guide covers the three game modes:
>* **Create-A-Sim (CAS)**: Design sims and customize their traits, skills, aspirations, and appearance.
>* **Build Mode**: Build and decorate your sim’s home. 
>* **Live Mode**: Manage needs, emotions, and lives of your sims.


This guide centers on PC controls. If you are playing on console, the Sims Guide website offers a [guide for Playstation and Xbox](https://thesimsguide.com/sims-4-basic-controls-for-playstation/#:~:text=Xbox%3A%20press%20X%20%2B%20Y%20at%20the%20same,the%20same%20time%2C%20then%20right%20stick%20to%20rotate) controls.

🗒️ **NOTE:** This guide is equipped with some beginner tips and cheat codes. These are not necessary for gameplay but are a great way to enhance your playing!

## Create-a-Sim
Whether you’re making yourself, your neighbor, or your celebrity crush, here's how you create a sim!

When starting in CAS, the game prompts you to pick to **Create a Story** or **Start from Scratch.**

**Create a Story** expedites the creation process by asking questions and assigning your sim traits, aspirations, and an appearance. If you’re unhappy with the outcome, _everything is changeable_. Saying, “No Thanks” to the story will drop you into customization. You can also download other players’ sims from [the gallery](https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sims_4_Gallery). 

![The Create a Sim main screen, showing a sim against a blue background](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkvQElPJbx.png)

### Traits and Aspirations 
![Hexagonal icons where you select traits and apsirations, each filled with a diverse image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1yqrePk-g.png)

[Traits](https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Trait_(The_Sims_4)) are cornerstones of your sim’s personality, determining how they interact with their environment. 
>🗒️ **NOTE:** Traits are **permanent** once you finish your sim.

[Aspirations](https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Aspiration_(The_Sims_4)) function as your sim’s ultimate life goal.


Click the hexagons in the upper left of the screen to access traits and aspirations. Likes and dislikes, found beneath the panel, are best left unchosen, as your sim develops them in-game.


### Appearance
Appearance refers to the physical and biological aspects of your sim.

![Create a Sim menu screen with appearance wheel open, showing a verticle wheel of icons](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1mAz-uJbg.jpg)

Click the diamond in the top left to alter a sim’s biology, including gender, age, voice, and relationship to other created sims.

Clicking on your sim opens the **appearance wheel**. Clicking different body parts provides different choices for clothing and body modifications.

![Menu showing upperwear clothing options and the situation they relate to](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkAONb_yZl.jpg)



Above the column listing clothing choices, there is a row of icons, each relating to a specific social setting. The type of clothing shown depends on the selected setting.
To the left of your sim, the two vertical sliders correspond to muscularity and weight.

💡**TIP:** If you want to precisely modify your sim, enter **detail-edit-mode** by clicking on the eyeglass icon to the left of your sim’s head.

Finally, give your sim a name in the top left corner. Click the checkmark in the bottom right, and you’re done!

## Controls

Before you begin playing as your sim, let’s overview the controls for Build Mode and Live Mode.
Camera controls in these modes are identical and are for trackpad and mouse unless otherwise noted.

#### Camera Controls 
>* Moving the camera: Hold left click and drag, or use the WASD or arrow keys.
>* Readjusting camera angle: Hold right click and drag.
>* Zooming in/out: Use the scroll wheel on the mouse. For the trackpad, use two fingers in the middle and scroll up or down.
>* Tilting the camera: Hold down the  scroll wheel on the mouse and move the whole mouse up and down. For the trackpad, hold down the command key and click the arrow keys.
#### In-Game Controls
>* Controlling time: Use the panel in the bottom middle of the screen to speed up, slow down, or pause time.
>* Moving between floors of a building: Click the up and down arrows in the top right.
>* Switching wall views (i.e. full, cutaway, no walls): Click the room icon in the top right.

## Build Mode

So, you made your sim and are ready to release them into the world! But wait—they need a house first!

### Getting Started 

After exiting CAS, the game prompts you to pick a world to live in. It doesn’t matter which world you pick—your sim can always move later.
Once you’ve selected your world, choose a lot to move your sim into. 

Empty lots let you build your house with your remaining funds whereas built lots let you purchase a pre-furnished or unfurnished home. If you don’t like the layout, you can change it in Build Mode; it’s completely customizable! (Just keep an eye on your funds).

🗒️ **NOTE:** Your sim’s household always starts with 20,000 Simoleons. 

### Build Mode Features

![Sims build mode open, showing multiple panels and a grid above a housing lot](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sy2XmbOyWl.jpg)


Alright! You’ve bought your lot and moved in! The game drops your sim into Live Mode, and you can’t modify your home from this mode. To access Build Mode, click the hammer and wrench icon in the top right menu. 

🗒️ **NOTE:** When you enter Build Mode, your sim and time will pause.

Wow, that’s a lot of stuff on the screen! No worries, we detail each feature below.

#### The Grid
![Top down view of a house in build mode, showcasing the white grind around the property](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hypex-wkZg.jpg)

You will see a white grid surrounding the floor of your lot. The grid represents the buildable area, and the tiles that items will align to. The grid ensures the walls of your home and the items within don’t interrupt sims movements through the space.

To hide the grid, press G.
#### The Tool Bar
![Close up of the tool bar in build mode, with multiple icons in a row](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJpRlZDJ-e.jpg)

The tool bar, at the top middle of the screen, holds these essential tools (from left to right):
>* Select
>* Eyedropper 
>* Design
>* Sledgehammer 
>* Undo and Redo
>* Save to Library
>* Move House
>* Bulldoze
>>* Bulldoze Lot

For an in-depth look at these tools and other aspects of Build Mode, see this Build Mode [Guide by the SimsWiki](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Build_mode_(The_Sims_4)%23Build_mode_tools&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1762210371025807&usg=AOvVaw1NSLz3Ll5FE7K5XmW_nOZ0).
#### Lot Info Panel
![Two menues showcasing proptery lot details](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJg_G-Pybx.jpg)

The [Lot Info Panel](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Build_mode_(The_Sims_4)%23Lot_info_panel&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1762210371031428&usg=AOvVaw2ve_Xd6JRcPTVs_oAE9vaI), at the top left of the screen, contains essential information about your lot, including lot type, dimensions, value, and [traits and challenges](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Lot_traits_and_challenges%23Base_game&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1762210371025491&usg=AOvVaw3uqvaE7QEkouG6WgvGCKlh).
#### Build Buy Menu

![Close-up view of the build by menu, showing a house and furniture silhouettes](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJuwmbu1-g.jpg)


The Build Buy Menu is the large panel at the bottom left of your screen with three categories. You can switch between categories by clicking on their respective icons flush to the left side of the menu. 
>* [Build Catalog](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Build_mode_(The_Sims_4)%23Build&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1762210371031774&usg=AOvVaw2rNeFlzT3p8qsdfuc88mOS) (house icon): opens when you enter Build Mode, with a large interactive house image, and is the primary directory for items relevant to exterior decor and foundational building.
>* Objects-by-Room (chair-in-a-box icon): brings up a large interactive image of a kitchen setting. To move between rooms, click the related icons located above the interactive image.
>* Objects-by-Function (single chair icon): contains a drop down menu to select specific functions, like surface or plumbing. 
>
💡**TIP**:  You can resell any purchased item with the sledgehammer. 
### Common Questions
As you explore Build Mode, below are a few questions you might ask yourself.

>*“I want to push this object against the wall, but the game won’t let me. Why?”*

The game is particular about where items can go. To place objects without constraints, pull up the **cheat window** by pressing **CTRL + Shift + C**. In the pop-up bar, type **“bb.moveobjects on”** to place objects wherever. Check out this [cheats guide](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.carls-sims-4-guide.com/cheats.php%23google_vignette&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1762210371015582&usg=AOvVaw1nvujEQdVT5h7XAqjTF76N) for a longer, detailed explanation of available cheats and what they do.

![Panel opened showing the cheat window. It is blank besides one line of text saying "MoveObjects cheat is ON"](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryrkPWPyZg.jpg)


💡**TIP**: Freely placing objects might impact their functionality. Play-test in Live Mode when building with cheats.

>*“Woah, I just went down a floor level, and it’s really dark. What is this?”*

Welcome to the **basement**! Basement levels function the same as your above-ground levels. It’s important to note that **you must build a room in the basement level before you can place objects**. Also, ensure you have a staircase otherwise your basement will be inaccessible!

![Basement of sim's house, or white grid over a black background](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rybsYbPk-g.jpg)

>*“There’s an object in the world that I really like, but I can’t find it in Build Mode. Why?”*

The object is likely a part of the **debug menu**. Debug items are used in world, but not available for purchase in Build Mode. However, using cheats lets you access these items for free in Build Mode. See this [debug guide](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gamesradar.com/the-sims-4-debug-cheat/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1762210371016101&usg=AOvVaw3UgFpwg4F91T4yNLu2M4tj) for a better look at how to use it.

Build Mode is one of the more complicated aspects of the game, but you’ll learn more features as you progress. Right now, this overview is a great start to familiarize yourself with the basics of Build Mode.

To return to Live Mode, click the two-people icon located in the top right menu.

## Live Mode
You have your character and house, and now you’re ready to play as your sim! Here’s what to know about Live Mode.

### Controlling Sims 
Look at your beautiful sim! Uh-Oh, where are they? If you can’t find them in the world, **left-click their portrait** in the household panel. To follow them, **right click their household portrait**.

You can only control one sim at a time — switch between sims by **left clicking their household portraits**.

You aren’t just here to watch your sim — you’re here to play as them! 

>* Click on sims in the world to see available interactions with them.
>* Your sim's actions will queue in the order you choose them, and the icons  appear in the bottom left corner.
>* Some actions continue until you tell your sim to stop by left clicking the action icon.
>* Actions with the orange circle are instant actions done by the player.  
![In-game action that says "Send Home" with an orange circle beside it](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkuhXZdJZe.jpg)

>* When your sim leaves a location without you following them, their household portrait grays out. Click the two-person icon in their portrait to see available actions.                      
![Small icon of two people above the sim's minature portrait](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyLXSzPkWx.jpg)


🗒️ **NOTE:** Around each action icon will be a progress circle, showing time until completion.

### Needs
What do we want? Needs! When do we want them? Now!

![Panel showing a sim's needs in bars with differing fullness. Needs include bladder, fun, hunger, social, energy, and hygiene](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1lb6ZvJ-x.jpg)

The Needs tab is in the Utility Panel (UP) at the bottom right of the screen. Based on a sim’s needs, they will gain moodlets that determine their [emotional state](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Emotion&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1762210371039777&usg=AOvVaw2YVXOo8Vq47e6gaLnxAhvG), displayed under their character portrait. Moodlets result from actions, events, and in-game experiences.

>* To satisfy a sim’s needs, queue actions related to the specific need.
>>* Ex. Have them eat to satisfy their hunger. 
>* If you fail to satisfy a sim’s needs, there may be consequences.
>>* If they are too tired, they may faint!
### Wants and Aspirations
You chose an aspiration for your sim when you made them, and to see the tasks to complete it, click the **gold icon** in the UP. 


💡**TIP**:  Completing the aspiration allows you to pick a new one for your sim and grants them a longer lifespan!


**Wants** are the thought bubbles above your sim's character portrait. There are no consequences for not fulfilling these or aspirations.

>* Wants go away on their own unless you **pin them** by clicking the pushpin near them.
>* Completing a want or aspiration grants you aspiration points. 
>>* To spend these, go to the **Aspiration** tab and click “Rewards Store.”
>* The [Rewards Store](https://discover.hubpages.com/games-hobbies/The-Sims-4-Walkthrough-Rewards-Store-Guide) has items and traits you may purchase for the selected sim. 
### Skills 
Some wants and aspirations involve learning skills! 

>* Your sim’s skills and their levels are under the **Skills** tab in the UP.
>>* Don’t fret if this is blank! Build Mode contains items that increase skills, or your sim can purchase a book on a skill. 
>>>* To buy a book, click on any bookshelf. 

>* Reaching higher levels of skills unlocks new abilities.
>* When your sim does a skill-increasing action, a bar appears above their head to show skill progress.
>>* Most skill actions will only stop when you cancel the action.

💡**TIP**: The **Handiness** skill is obtained through fixing items. If your sim attempts to fix an electronic after already being electrocuted by it, they will die on the second attempt. Save your game before fixing electronics with a low Handiness skill!

Some skills and their objects include Comedy (microphone), Gaming (computer), and Painting (easel). Check out this [list of skills](https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_skills_%28The_Sims_4%29#The_Sims_4_-_Base_Game) your sim can achieve.

### Careers
Let’s get to work! If you don’t want a traditional career for your sim, they can use skills for profit, such as selling paintings or publishing books.

Want a 9-5? Click the **Career** tab, the briefcase icon in the UP, to find a job!

![Pop-up menu showing sim career options, including astronaut, athlete, etc.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hk4C6bw1Wg.jpg)

Once you select a career, you can find your sim’s progress towards a promotion and their work schedule in the *Career* tab.
>* Jobs have tasks to do before every shift if you want your sim to progress faster in their career.
>* Sims will go to work on their own. If you cancel the action, send them to work by clicking “Go to Work” in the **Career** tab. 
>>* Being late or missing work will lower your sim's work performance; if their performance is too low, they’ll be demoted.

Clicking the two-person icon on a household portrait provides actions for your sim at work that will affect their performance. **Working hard** increases a sim’s work performance while **socializing** increases relationships. Hover over the different options to see details.

### Relationships
Your sim is flourishing. A job, skills, and a house—now all they need are some friends!

>* When you interact with a sim, a bar at the top of the screen shows your sim’s relationship with them.
![Box including a sim's portrait in the top left, and a bar beneath showing relationship progress](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJrdRWDkZg.jpg)
>>* Green is friendship, pink is romance, red is dislike.

Interactions will affect the relationship progression differently depending on the conversational likes of the sim you’re interacting with.
>* Ex. When Mischief interactions are performed on a sim that dislikes Mischief, friendship will decrease.

💡**TIP**: When romance is low with another sim, bold romantic interactions, like a pick-up line, are unlikely to succeed. 

### Events and Traveling 
Events are one of many features that allow you to meet other sims. The first event you encounter is the Welcome Wagon.

>* The Welcome Wagon prompts your sim’s neighbors to come meet you, their new neighbor! 
>>* Your neighbors will bring a fruitcake as a gift. The fruitcake is infamous in the Sims community. Don’t let your sim eat it or they’ll gain an uncomfortable moodlet for the rest of the day.

For all events, like the Welcome Wagon, there will be an icon and panel in the top left corner. 

![Pop-up panel describing the Welcome Wagon event](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJMxffDJZg.jpg)
>* If you complete the tasks for an event, your sim may receive a reward.

💡**TIP**: Not all events will have tasks. If your sim is invited to an event, there will be no tasks to complete.

>* If you wish to end an event early, click the timer icon in the event panel.

Events include dates, parties, weddings, and more. You can start an event by using the phone located below the character portrait. 

Traveling is another way to get out and meet other sims. To **travel**, click on your sim or phone and find the “travel” button.
>* You will be given the choice to travel alone or with other sims!
>* When traveling to another sim’s house, their icon will be translucent if they’re not home and opaque if they are.
>* Click the home icon on a sim’s household portrait to send them home.
>* You will have to do this for each sim in your household that you want to send home if they are traveling together.

## Wrapping Up
And that’s it! The rest of your gameplay is up to you. Remember, there are no wrong ways to play. Have fun!
